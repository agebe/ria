* enable/disable script features
* script firewall (which java methods are allowed/denied)
* bit operators?
* other assign operator e.g. +=, -= etc.
* switch statement?
* throw exceptions
  -> modify stack trace to contain script functions and line numbers
* get rid of char literal and make single and double quotes same for string literal
* script imports should come before auto imports (other than java.lang.*)
* anonymous types via new operator. implement interfaces (also partial) or override some/all methods of a class.
  -> actually allow any statements in the objects scope like e.g. expr : expr { stmt* }
     The difference to the block statement is that we are in the objects scope, changing fields
     (if public otherwise call setter) or calling methods. the expression evaluates to the same object, with
     its internal state modified as per the statements.
     Adding or overwriting methods should probably only be possible together with the new operator?
* apache license on all files
* add builtin function (e.g. exec) for scripting
