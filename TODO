* enable/disable script features
* script firewall (which java methods are allowed/denied)
* bit operators?
* other assign operator e.g. +=, -= etc.
* text blocks
* switch statement?
* throw exceptions (and improve exception handling e.g. don't wrap every exception in ScriptException)
* try-catch (with resources?)
* anonymous types via new operator. implement interfaces (also partial) or override some/all methods of a class.
  -> actually allow any statements in the objects scope like e.g. expr : expr { stmt* }
     The difference to the block statement is that we are in the objects scope, changing fields
     (if public otherwise call setter) or calling methods. the expression evaluates to the same object, with
     its internal state modified as per the statements.
     Adding or overwriting methods should probably only be possible together with the new operator?
* apache license on all files
* script launcher
* script dependencies
* add builtin function (e.g. exec) for scripting
